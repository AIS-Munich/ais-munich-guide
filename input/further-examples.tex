\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Simply use the section and subsection commands, as in this example document. With Overleaf, all the formatting and numbering is handled automatically according to the template you've chosen. If you're using Rich Text mode, you can also create new section and subsections via the buttons in the editor toolbar.

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link in 
the file-tree menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document.
 Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and
 a caption to your figure. See the code for Figures
 in this section for an example.
Note that your figure will automatically be placed in the most appropriate place for it, given the surrounding text and taking into account other figures or tables that may be close by. You can find out more about adding images to your documents in this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Including_images_on_Overleaf}{including images on Overleaf}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{logo.png}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded via the file-tree menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular environments for basic tables --- see Table, for example. For more information, please see this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/tables}{tables}. 

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to add Comments and Track Changes}

Comments can be added to your project by highlighting some text and clicking ``Add comment'' in the top right of the editor pane. To view existing comments, click on the Review menu in the toolbar above. To reply to a comment, click on the Reply button in the lower right corner of the comment. You can close the Review pane by clicking its name on the toolbar when you're done reviewing for the time being.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let\(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with\(\text{E}[X_i] = \mu\) and\(\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty\), and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as\(n\) approaches infinity, the random variables\(\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)\) converge in distribution to a normal\(\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\).
